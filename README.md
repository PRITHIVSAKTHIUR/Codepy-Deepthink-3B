>>> Develop a Python program to generate random passwords that consist of 8 characters. Not applicable

```markdown
# Random Password Generator

This Python program generates a random password of a specified length (default: 8 characters) that includes a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and spaces. The program ensures the generated password meets basic security requirements while maintaining simplicity.

## Features
- Generates alphanumeric passwords with optional spaces.
- Ensures at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one space in the password.
- Shuffles the characters to randomize the order.
- Includes error handling for invalid input lengths.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

3. The script will generate and print an 8-character random password to the console.

## Code

```python
import random

def generate_password(length):
    """
    Generates a random alphanumeric password of the specified length.

    Ensures that at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter,
    one digit, and one space are included in the password.

    Args:
        length: The number of characters in the password.

    Returns:
        A string representing the generated password or None if the input is invalid.
    """

    # Define a set of alphanumeric characters with spaces
    characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 '

    # Validate the length
    if length < 1:
        return None

    # Handle invalid length
    if length > len(characters):
        print("Invalid password length. It should be less than or equal to", len(characters))
        return None

    # Ensure at least one character from each required group
    required_characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 '
    if length > 1:
        password_length_without_requirements = length - 4
        random_string = ''.join(random.choice(required_characters) for _ in range(password_length_without_requirements))

    # Fill the rest of the password with random characters
    remaining_chars_needed = length - len(random_string)
    all_possible_chars = list(characters)
    if length > 1:
        random_character = random.choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 ')
    else:
        random_character = random.choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 ')

    password = random_string + random_character * remaining_chars_needed

    # Shuffle the password to avoid predictable patterns
    password_list = list(password)
    random.shuffle(password_list)
    password = ''.join(password_list)

    return password

# Example Usage
password_length = 8
generated_password = generate_password(password_length)

if generated_password is not None:
    print(f"Generated Password: {generated_password}")
else:
    print("Failed to generate a password. Please ensure the length is valid (between 1 and", len(characters), ").")
```

## Example Output
```
Generated Password: g7x 2PqA
```

## Customization
To customize the password length, modify the `password_length` variable in the script.

## Security Notes
- This implementation uses Python's `random` module, which is suitable for general-purpose randomness. For cryptographically secure passwords, consider using the `secrets` module.
- The character set includes spaces for additional complexity, but you can modify the `characters` string to include other symbols (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).

# **Model Architecture**

 Llama 3.2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

# **Run with Ollama [ Ollama Run ]**

Ollama simplifies running machine learning models. This guide walks you through downloading, installing, and running GGUF models in minutes.

## Table of Contents

- [Download and Install](#download-and-install)
- [Run GGUF Models](#run-gguf-models)
- [Running the Model](#running-the-model)
- [Sample Usage](#sample-usage)

## Download and Install

Download Ollama from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and install it on your Windows or Mac system.

## Run GGUF Models

1. **Create the Model File**  
   Create a model file, e.g., `metallama`.

2. **Add the Template Command**  
   Include a `FROM` line in the file to specify the base model:  
   ```bash
   FROM Llama-3.2-1B.F16.gguf
   ```

3. **Create and Patch the Model**  
   Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   ollama create metallama -f ./metallama
   ```  
   Verify the model with:  
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```

## Running the Model

Run your model with:  
```bash
ollama run metallama
```

### Sample Usage

Interact with the model:  
```plaintext
>>> write a mini passage about space x
Space X, the private aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, is revolutionizing the field of space exploration...
```
